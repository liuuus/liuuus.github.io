            <h6 class="mb-3" style="color: grey;"> </h6>
            <h6 class="mb-3" style="color: grey;"> Throughout my life, curiosity has been the main driver of change, <br>of constructing and deconstructing myself. It has lead to personal and professional development and motivated me to learn about the neverending complexity of our world.</h6>
            <h6 class="mb-3" style="color: grey;"> While it's true that we are just existing, curiosity helps me overcome the pessimism of nihilism. I like using existing instead of living because it seems that when you see the meaninglessness of the world, you can do whatever to create your own living out of existence. Poetic, I know, but to me it’s true.<br> Throw away the glass, it’s not half full or half empty. It’s a glass. </h6>
            <h6 class="mb-3" style="color: grey;"> When I was younger, I wanted to change the world. Now I understand that it's impossible. What is possibile though is to leave it a tiny bit better than when you first appeared here. I think that's what I'm trying to do.</h6>

            <h2 class="mb-4"  >interests</h2>
            <h6 class="mb-3" style="color: grey;"> Summarizing this is definitely not easy. Lately, my mind has been quite hyper, pushing, pulling, creating and destroying my beliefs and opinions. <br> Here are some things I have found intriguing lately, <br> here is my food for thought.</h6>
            <h5 class="mb-3" style="color: olive;"> urban mobility</h5>
            <h6 class="mb-3" style="color: grey;"> Having lived in multiple countries, I have learned that accessible and affordable transportation within cities definitely affects your experience, making places liveable and human-centered or unberable to navigate without a car, pointing at structural issues. <br> I love bike-sharing, trams and single transportation cards for all types of transit. Bicycle urbanism though is something that I feel very passionate about. It's fascinating to me that we only now understand the significance of a bicycle as a mean of transportation. </h6>
            <h5 class="mb-3" style="color: olive;"> sustainability but with a focus on <br>indigenous knowledge and biomimicry</h5>
            <h6 class="mb-3" style="color: grey;"> Currently, I am reading Braiding Sweetgrass: Indigenous Wisdom, Scientific Knowledge, and the Teachings of Plants by Robin Wall Kimmerer to expand my knowledge in the field. I am curious about building environmentally-friendly seawalls, guerilla gardening, community gardens and hydroponics. </h6>
            <h5 class="mb-3" style="color: olive;"> DIY urbanism </h5>
            <h6 class="mb-4" style="color: grey;" > I love all things related to Tactical Urbanism! There is so much power within these community-led efforts and seeing these efforts turn into successful interventions in the city fabric simply inspires me. Some of my favorite initiatives are parklets, guerilla wayfinding and community libraries. </h6>
            <h5 class="mb-3" style="color: olive;"> data science for social good</h5>
            <h6 class="mb-3" style="color: grey;"> Something I have been thinking about is how can we take charge of the large amounts of data that are being collected every second and use it on a small scale. I believe that using this data to learn about people's everyday challenges, to uncover historical silences and to focus on experiences of underrepresented communities, <br>we can make our cities more inclusive, connected and equitable. </h6>


            <h2 class="mb-4"  >hobbies</h2>
            <h6 class="mb-3" style="color: grey;"> I am lucky to be surrounded by creative people that inspire me to search for new hobbies and things to try out. Here are a couple of my favorites:</h6>
            <h5 class="mb-3" style="color: olive;"> crocheting</h5>
            <h6 class="mb-3" style="color: grey;"> I make bags, hats, vests and I love working with yarn. It's a practice that allows freeing myself from my thoughts and focusing on the moment. Unfortunately, due to much traveling, the amount of crocheted pieces is limited to the size of my suitcases. <br> When I have leftover yarn, I make coasters for my friends. </h6>
            <h5 class="mb-3" style="color: olive;"> journaling</h5>
            <h6 class="mb-3" style="color: grey;"> I love getting my thoughts out on paper for self-reflection. When there is an abundance of them, I use Notion as my personal diary. I really enjoy looking back at them and seeing the past Liuda. <br>She is so me, yet we differ a lot. </h6>
            <h5 class="mb-3" style="color: olive;"> doodling/watercolor painting</h5>
            <h6 class="mb-3" style="color: grey;">  My doodles are usually unintentional and I doodle a lot while in class or when bored. Doing this aimlessly allows me to let go of the idea that everything needs to have an intention. Sometimes you just are here, in this endless space. <br>Watercolor painting has been very fun lately. As a child, I loved drawing and I am hoping to bring this love to drawing back. </h6>

            <h6 class="mb-3" style="color: grey;"> </h6>
            <h6 class="mb-3" style="color: grey;"> </h6>
            <h6 class="mb-3" style="color: grey;">As a historical forces and data science student, I do not directly study urban planning. At first, I saw this as a crucial mistake in my academic journey but the sunk cost fallacy said "stay". </h6>
            <h6 class="mb-3" style="color: grey;">Today I see my majors at Minerva as useful if not crucial for urbanism since it's such an inspiringly complex field that requires collaboration of individuals from diverse disciplines and backgrounds. </h6>
            <h6 class="mb-3" style="color: grey;">Thus, urbanism-related projects displayed in my portfolio are largely self-directed. I found navigating the field quite challenging, especially because I often felt as if my passion for city planning, willingness to learn, related coursework or side projects were not enough simply because I don't have "Urban Planning" as my major.</h6>
            <h6 class="mb-3" style="color: grey;">Due to this, I took control over my individual learning to gain relevant experiences before starting my Master's degree in Urban Studies. As part of my Individual Learning Plan, I frequently participate in informational interviews with urbanists, read articles on topics of interest daily, dedicate my academic assignments to urban planning whenever possible, work as a student intern with the Student Life team at Minerva and much more!</h6>
            <h6 class="mb-3" style="color: grey;">Having found my tiny place within urbanism, I felt motivated to make someone else's learning more pleasant and effective. Thus, I have created an Individual Learning Template for Notion that allows you to structure your studies, set priorities, keep track of your habits, and play around with other features I found essential for myself.</h6>
            <span class="subheading" style="color: olive;">The Template's home is in roads: big & small!</span>
