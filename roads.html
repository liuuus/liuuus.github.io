                <p class="mb-4" style="color: grey;" > I completed this project with Andre Vacha as part of the Interdisciplinary Sustainable Design course at Minerva. Our site visit to Recoleta Cemetery in Buenos Aires, Argentina, proved that despite the cemetery's cultural and aesthetic significance and international recognition, the future of crypts experiencing uncontrolled decay at Recoleta is challenging to predict. While we started the project with contrasting experiences related to cemeteries, the shared values of circularity and recognition allowed us to develop a design process that considers two levels - the individual crypt and the cemetery system. Using the design principles of decay over disposal, upcycling, sustainable crypts, and system over object, we answer the following question: How might we conceptualize the crypts' lifecycles at Recoleta Cemetery to enable Recoleta Cemetery Operations Management to modify their purposes while preserving their aesthetic, cultural, and national value?</p>

                <p class="mb-4" style="color: grey;" > I realized there is a lot I don’t know about what my ancestors wore besides a  vyshyvanka because my knowledge of Ukrainian adornments and clothing is significantly impacted by the Soviet myths and russia’s continued attempts to erase Ukrainian culture. While I was particularly interested to learn about the adornments prevalent in Volyn oblast of Ukraine since I was born and raised here, the available information was very scarce. <br>Thus, this mini project’s exploratory question is centered around using something as specific as a map to communicate our knowledge about Volyn’s adornments of the 19th-20th century while creating space to show the “fuzziness” of this information. Since regular data visualizations fail at showcasing uncertainty, I wondered if using a map will have the same shortcoming or if there are ways around it.  </p>

              <p class="mb-4" style="color: grey;" > I continued working on San Francisco’s Parks and Recreation Department public-facing data on green space properties managed by the authority. In the first article, I cleaned two data sets provided by the Department to exclude properties that cannot be qualified as parks, such as playgrounds, recreation centers, golf and tennis courts, libraries, and the zoo. <br>The guiding question of part 2 of 2 is, “Are there differences between the cleaned and original park data shown in the 10-minute walking distances around green spaces?” This article aims to create two primary data visualizations based on the cleaned and the original data, which would show the audience the 10-minute walking distances (half-a-mile radius) from each mapped green space.  </p>
              <span class="subheading" style="color: olive;">Myth or Reality: Do San Franciscans Actually Live a 10-Minute Walk Within a Park?</span>
              <p class="mb-4" style="color: grey;" > In 2017, San Francisco became the first city in the United States where 100 percent of its residents live within a 10-minute walk to a park, assessed by the Trust for Public Land based on park inventories taken from park-owning agencies. Still, instead of considering the number of parks per city, the ParkScore assesses the green space land area. Due to this, comparing the number of green spaces in San Francisco to the Trust for Public Land’s analysis is not very straightforward. Luckily, San Francisco P&R Department’s website provides various datasets on the parkland it manages in the city. Yet, after browsing the data, I began questioning whether each San Franciscan actually lives 10 minutes within a park. This is part 1 of 2, in which I explore the question: How does our understanding of green space in today’s San Francisco change once we examine recent public-facing green space data provided by San Francisco P&R Department?</p>

                <p class="mb-4" style="color: grey;" > This is not your regular tour of Berlin! Berlin's Colonialist Present is a tour of the African Quarter's toponymy, in which all the stops encompass street and place names that have a colonial legacy. During this walking tour, I invite the audience to challenge the right of these place names to exist along with the current democratic principles. I argue that by staying up these names not only keep the power dynamics between the oppressor and the oppressed alive, but also contribute to the intergenerational trauma of those who live in the African Quarter or visit it. <br> The Spark Page includes the links to the map of the tour with the stops, their descriptions, audio recording and the source files attached, as well as a Reflection essay on the process of making a walking tour. </p>

                <p class="mb-4" style="color: grey;" > Ahmed’s writings on the philosophy of happiness and feminism provide a unique lens through which we can view the ethical issues of distanced tourism in Brazilian favelas. I weave in arguments from Ahmed's 2010 piece Killing Joy: Feminism and the History of Happiness to study the introduction of cable cars in Rio de Janeiro's favelas by viewing happiness as a tool used by those with the most power. Extending Ahmed’s idea of killjoys to this case study does not only allow us to see what killjoys have been asked to give up but also what they have not received despite sharing their priorities regarding the improvement of favela life. This prompts us to think about who our cities are built for and how the top-down power dynamics penetrate and stay in our urban environments.  </p>

                <p class="mb-4" style="color: grey;" > This is my first try with spatial analysis using QGIS! In this tutorial, I use Census records and Sanborn insurance maps of 1900 as primary sources to form a historical question for a research project. I georeferenced the Sanborn map onto San Francisco's South Market neighborhood and geocoded the points from the Census records. As a result, I created a map that showcases the diversity of building usage and the variety of occupation types in South Market. I use this snapshot of the socio-economic landscape to hypothesize a certain "flattening"(decrease in diversity of occupation and building use) and suggest further guidelines for extending this piece to a research project.</p>

In this critical essay, I have used philosophical concepts of property ownership, the state of nature, social contract theory, and the fair play account of political obligation to discuss the future of KØPI - a 32-year-old squat in Central Berlin. I have studied two main stances regarding the topic, one that
supports KØPI’s current state and location, and another that is in favor of the

                  <p class="mb-4" style="color: grey;" > In her 1997 essay Is Multiculturalism Bad for Women?, Susan Okin argues that individual rights should be prioritized over group rights because multiculturalism fails to protect the rights of in-group individuals while providing the larger umbrella group rights and privileges. I argue that individual rights should not have higher significance than group rights, but instead, there must be mediation between individual and group rights, leading to the compliance with these rights developing through the inner dynamics of a group to maintain its cultural integrity.</p>

                <p class="mb-4" style="color: grey;" > I agree with Trouillot that past is not a fixed reality as we have the power and agency to rethink it and highlight the underrepresented voices. Unsilencing the experience of Seneca Village was my primary focus for this project. The narrative of the Central Park's creation is centered around "important men" who destroyed an African-American and immigrant neighborhood of Seneca Village. In this paper, I use hegemony(Gramsci), representations of space(Lefebvre) and utilitarianism to study the significance of Seneca Village and showcase that it's destruction was justified by eco-gentrification performed by local elites. <br> An interesting realization from this project is that the construction of Central Park was essentialy the first instance of massive environmental gentrification in the US.</p>

                <p class="mb-4" style="color: grey;" > For a couple of years now I have been fascinated with DIY urbanism. I believe that there is so much power and individual agency within these DIY urbanism practices. After watching the VOX video on guerilla gardening in NYC, I felt inspired and wrote a case study about Green Guerillas and Lefebvre's concept of "the right to the city." Despite always viewing such community-led efforts as essentially positive, in this paper I get a little critical and develop a point about formalization of some aspects of guerilla gardening for the effective long-term development of the practice. This project also provided an opportunity to view something I agree with and believe in from a critical perspective.</p>

                    <p class="mb-4" style="color: grey;" > I learned about deep mapping and psychogeography in spring 2020 while researching about cartography. I was immediately fascinated by deep maps and their ability to shift the "traditional" power dynamic embedded in maps. By diverging from the original usage of maps(for conquest, control, exercise of political power), they challenge those practices and offer an alternative use of maps: for creativity, self-expression, discovery of your feelings and thoughts about your environment. In this paper I study the emergence of deep maps by discussing French Situationism, digitalization and the need to see cartography as a process rather than an end. I explain my understanding of the deep maps' increased popularity through media and cultural convergences. I also provide a short analysis of three deep maps, pointing at their diversity.</p>

We touch upon a lot of difficult topics, such as the effects of the car-centrism on minority communities, the emergence of the white flight, the causes and outcomes of suburbanization and power dynamics that shaped racial relations, gender roles, and American identity. </p>

Insure" (2015) by Cai et. al and used R to replicate some of the results of the study. I further extended my replication of the linear regression results by performing three types of matching: Mahalanobis(multivariable) distance matching, genetic matching and propensity score
matching. </p>

We were tasked to solve an urban planning challenge of a Ukrainian city. Our work was centered around the lack of bicycling navigation on Khortytsya island. We prototyped a model consisting of a digital and a social solution for sustainable development of cycling on Khortytsya. I was mainly responsible for the social aspect of our prototype, planning the VeloSich Quest for 500 cyclists to engage with Khortytsya, for which I evaluated business strategies and analyzed navigation maps and local cycling events. </p>

                        <p class="mb-4" style="color: grey;" > I initiated this research project while interning at State Cultural and Historical Reserve "Ancient Volodymyr" in my hometown in Ukraine. In this research, I studied the same street but about a century apart and analyzed the functions of the street, specifically function loss, weakening and persistence. I defined a "successful" public place and use The Place Diagram by the Project for Public Spaces as a tool for comparative analysis of the street in different time periods. For assessing the components of The Place Diagram for Knyazya Vasylka Street, I used qualitative and quantitative data I collected through an online survey and for assessing the same components of Farna Street, I interviewed a history researcher from "Ancient Volodymyr." I have also used concepts from complexity science, such as feedback loops, phase spaces and pushing force to strengthen my analysis.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4" style="color: grey;" > Having lived next to a cemetery for majority of middle and high school, I started wondering: what is the future of cemeteries, what do we do with them? In this article I touch upon the history of cemeteries, use symbolic-interactionism and structural-functionalism to study cemeteries as part of our built and social landscapes. I raise a question of why cemeteries are not considered public places and suggest that we have an opportunity to rethink the way we perceive and interact with cemeteries, further proposing solutions on how to achieve this. <br>Note: due to a lag in the system, Anh Chu is incorrencrly assigned as a coauthor; <br>I am the only author of this piece. </p>
